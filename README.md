# Player MacOS Webview

This application is for testing the Vimeo player from within a MacOS WebView.

To test, open the XCode project from within the XCode application. If you run the project, the player should appear.

In the ContentView file, you will find the player url hardcoded in. You can update this as needed for testing specific videos/params.
